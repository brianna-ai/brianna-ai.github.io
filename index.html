  <h2>Brianna Ai</h2>
  <p>Congratulations! You've found my website. Initially created while exploring my interests in the field of computer science, I came to realize I did not (and still do not) enjoy web design. Thankfully there are still plenty of other things to try - like NLP and game development - and things I would like to continue to learn about - like security and general software development. If you have any work related to any of those let me know!</p>
