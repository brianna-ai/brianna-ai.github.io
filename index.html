  <h2>Brianna Ai</h2>
  <p>This is my interactive (slightly more detailed) resume! It is under construction.</p>
  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>I am a second-year undergrad student studying computer science at the University of Waterloo. I began coding in grade 12 and found that I loved finding solutions to various challenges presented to me. To continue learning, I travelled from my home in Saskatoon to pursue more challenges in Waterloo. Challenge inspires growth, and I look forward to see where it might take me next!</p>
  <h3>Hobbies and Interests</h3>
  <p>Outside of computer science, I love learning about all sorts of new things. Some things I enjoy learning about include linguistics, rhetoric, and literature. Hobbies also include drawing, reading, and playing guitar!</p>
